    <br>One of the things i really miss is going to the beach! </br>
        I lived by one hour and a half off the beach, I could have gone every weekend since realizing  
        that Utah is that far from the beach :(  </p>
        
        <p>There's a list of <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.co/Attractions-g294324-Activities-c61-t52-Venezuela.html"> The most beautiful 30 beaches in Venezuela</a> (I've been on 15 of those 30!)</p>

        <article>I grew up in <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_(Carabobo)">San Diego</a>, where its geographic distribution feels very similar to Utah (a valley surrounded by two mountains), it almost feels like home!</article>

        <p>One of the most impactful things that forged my personality and brought me to the world of technology was...</p>
        <h2>Videogames!</h2>
        <img class="mario-64" src="https://thechozoproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Feature-Image-1024x576.jpg" alt="Mario 64! one of my favorite games ever">
        <h4>Super Mario 64, one of my favorite games EVER!! </h4>

        <p>Since the beginning of the video game era, there has been a lot of misinformation about this medium, </br>
            as many people claimed that video games turned you into a violent and impulsive person, and quite the opposite! </br>
            Video games, in addition to being a very healthy source of entertainment (under responsible use), </br>
            can also help you learn many things! The vast majority of video games carry a message thanks to their narrative </br>
             in the story, or also as a mechanic attached to the gameplay itself.</p>
